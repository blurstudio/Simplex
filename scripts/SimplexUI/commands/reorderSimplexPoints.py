""" Transfer shapes between mismatched models

Given a 1:1 point correspondence, transfer the shapes from one
geometry to another. Figuring out the correspondence is currently
outside the scope of this tool, though I may release one later.

The point correspondence should look like an unordered range, and
will be used as a numpy index to get the output values. It's also
possible to invert the range if you think you've got it backwards
