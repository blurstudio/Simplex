    This assumes Scalar (W) Last formatted quaternions

    This uses some interesting math that I don't fully understand. But the idea
    came from a NASA paper on the topic.

    Apparently if you sum a bunch of the outer products of quaternions with
    themselves, and then take the largest eigenvector of the resulting 4x4
    matrix, that eigenvector is (in some sense) the average of those quaternions.

    The naiive idea of an average is the sum divided by the count. So if you
    multiply an average value by the count, you should get back the sum.

    So if I take this "average" of quaternions and do a "multiplication" by the
    count, I should get back something that looks like a "sum" of the quaternions

    And to do "multiplication by the count", I just extrapolate the quaternion
    by slerping it to that count.

    This may not be "correct", but it sure seems to behave like I want it to.
    And that's all that matters for this application.
